this is my test code for running R scripts in python

test file 1 requires me to manually input my R script and returns a forest plot pdf

test file 2 uses the subprocess function to automatically pull the R script and returns a forest plot pdf

read_all_sheets allows me to go through an excel file sheet-by-sheet, determine the data format and call the appropriate r-script, then combine all outputs into a single pdf and save it to the path I assigned

testing_function contains the code from checking_all_sheets expressed as a function + inputs for the user to interact with
